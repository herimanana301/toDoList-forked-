# **ToDo List Application**

## **Project Overview**
This is a full-stack **ToDo List application** that allows users to add, view, manage, and organize tasks. It features a **React frontend** for a responsive and dynamic UI and a **Flask backend** that handles task management, persistence, and **JWT-based authentication**. The project showcases a systematic approach to full-stack development, emphasizing **modern web development** best practices and gradual feature enhancements.

---

## **Features**
- **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and complete tasks with attributes such as descriptions, priorities, categories, and deadlines.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login system with JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a database (using **SQLite**) for long-term storage and retrieval.
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket (Socket.io) integration for live updates without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive UI**: The frontend uses a responsive design with modern UX principles for both desktop and mobile.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React, CSS Grid, Framer Motion (for animations)
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended
- **Database**: SQLite (future-proof for switching to other databases)
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket (Socket.io)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access

## **Project Setup**

### **Backend (Flask)**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set up the Python environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### **Frontend (React)**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the React Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## **Key Achievements**

### **JWT Authentication**
- Implemented secure user authentication using **JWT** to protect API routes and ensure that only authenticated users can create, update, and delete tasks. This required deep integration of frontend and backend security layers and thorough testing.

### **Real-Time Task Updates**
- Integrated **WebSocket (Socket.io)** to enable real-time task updates, ensuring users can see changes (task creation, deletion, completion) across devices and browsers without requiring page reloads.

### **UI/UX Overhaul**
- Updated the UI/UX to ensure a smooth, responsive design for desktop and mobile, improving user experience through better animations, real-time feedback, and task filtering/sorting options.

### **Database Integration**
- Transitioned from JSON-based persistence to **SQLite**, implementing data migrations to ensure smooth updates. **SQLAlchemy ORM** was used to manage the database efficiently, laying the groundwork for future scalability.

## **API Endpoints**

The Flask backend exposes several key endpoints for managing tasks:

- `POST /api/login`: Authenticate users and issue JWT.
- `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks for the authenticated user.
- `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
- `PUT /api/tasks/<task_id>`: Update task details.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/<task_id>`: Delete a task.
- `PUT /api/tasks/<task_id>/complete`: Mark a task as complete.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement password encryption, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.
- **Task Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on shared tasks with role-based permissions.
- **Task Analytics**: Add statistics and charts to help users analyze their task completion trends over time.
- **Push Notifications**: Integrate with third-party services to notify users of approaching deadlines or task updates.
